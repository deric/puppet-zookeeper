A puppet receipt for [Apache Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

## Requirements

  * Puppet 3.x, Puppet 4.x
  * Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.x
  * Binary or source package of ZooKeeper

## Basic Usage:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper': }
```

## Cluster setup

When running ZooKeeper in the distributed mode each node must have unique ID (`1-255`). The easiest way how to setup multiple ZooKeepers, is by using Hiera. If no ID is specified, the ID will attempt to be automatically set by regexing the last digits of the hostname. 

`hiera/host/zk1.example.com.yaml`:
```yaml
zookeeper::id: '1'
```
`hiera/host/zk2.example.com.yaml`:
```yaml
zookeeper::id: '2'
```
`hiera/host/zk3.example.com.yaml`:
```yaml
zookeeper::id: '3'
```
A ZooKeeper quorum should consist of odd number of nodes (usually `3` or `5`).
For defining a quorum it is enough to list all IP addresses of all its members.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  servers => {
    1 => '192.168.1.1',
    2 => '192.168.1.2',
    3 => '192.168.1.3',
  },
}
```
In case that an array is passed as `servers`, first ZooKeeper will be assigned `ID = 1`. This would produce following configuration:
```
server.1=192.168.1.1:2888:3888
server.2=192.168.1.2:2888:3888
server.3=192.168.1.3:2888:3888
```
where first port is `election_port` and second one `leader_port`. Both ports could be customized for each ZooKeeper instance.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  election_port => 2889,
  leader_port   => 3889,
  servers       => {
    1 => '192.168.1.1',
    2 => '192.168.1.2',
    3 => '192.168.1.3',
  }
}
```

### Observers

[Observers](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.0/zookeeperObservers.html) were introduced in ZooKeeper 3.3.0. To enable this feature simply state which of ZooKeeper servers are observing:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  servers   => ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2', '192.168.1.3', '192.168.1.4', '192.168.1.5'],
  observers => ['192.168.1.4', '192.168.1.5']
}
```
**Note**: Currently observer server needs to be listed between standard servers (this behavior might change in feature).

### Set binding interface

By default ZooKeeper should bind to all interfaces. When you specify `client_ip` only single interface
will be used. If `$::ipaddress` is not your public IP (e.g. you are using Docker) make sure to setup correct IP:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  client_ip => $::ipaddress_eth0
}
```

or in Hiera:

```yaml
zookeeper::client_ip: "%{::ipaddress_eth0}"
```

This is a workaround for a a [Facter issue](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT-380).

### ZooKeeper service

Use `service_provider` to override Puppet detection for starting service.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  service_provider    => 'init',
  manage_service_file => false,
}
```

Some reasonable values are:

  * `init` - RHEL6, Debian 7
  * `upstart` - Ubuntu
  * `systemd` - RHEL 7, Debian 8
  * `runit`
  * `none` - service won't be installed

Parameter `manage_service_file` controls whether service definition should be managed by Puppet (default: `false`). Currently supported for `systemd` and `init`.


### Systemd Unit 'After' and 'Want' control
By default the module will create the following Unit section in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/zookeeper.service
````
[Unit]
Description=Apache ZooKeeper
After=network.target
````

Both After and Want (omitted when using the module defaults) can be controled using this module.

E.g on CentOS 7 those might have to be configured for 'netwrok-online.target' using the following syntax:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
   systemd_unit_after => 'network-online.target',
   systemd_unit_want => 'network-online.target',
}
```

Which will modify the Unit section to look like:

````
[Unit]
Description=Apache ZooKeeper
Want=network-online.target
After=network-online.target
````

##  Parameters

   - `id` - cluster-unique zookeeper's instance id (1-255)
   - `datastore`
   - `datalogstore` - specifying this configures the `dataLogDir` ZooKeeper config values and allows for transaction logs to be stored in a different location, improving IO performance
   - `log_dir`
   - `purge_interval` - automatically will delete ZooKeeper logs (available since ZooKeeper 3.4.0)
   - `snap_retain_count` - number of snapshots that will be kept after purging (since ZooKeeper 3.4.0)
   - `min_session_timeout` - the minimum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 2 times the **tickTime** (since ZooKeeper 3.3.0)
   - `max_session_timeout` - the maximum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 20 times the **tickTime** (since ZooKeeper 3.3.0)
   - `manage_service` (default: `true`) whether Puppet should ensure running service
   - `manage_service_file` when enabled on RHEL 7.0 a systemd config will be managed
   - `ensure_account` controls whether `zookeeper` user and group will be ensured (set to `false` to disable this feature)
   - `install_method` controls whether ZooKeeper ist installed from binary (`package`) or source (`archive`) packages
   - `archive_version` allows to specify an arbitrary version of ZooKeeper when using source packages
   - `archive_install_dir` controls the installation directory when using source packages (defaults to `/opt`)
   - `archive_symlink` controls the name of a version-independent symlink when using source packages
   - `archive_dl_url` allows to change the download URL for source packages (defaults to apache.org)

and many others, see the `params.pp` file for more details.

If your distribution has multiple packages for ZooKeeper, you can provide all package names
as an array.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  packages => ['zookeeper', 'zookeeper-java']
}
```
## Logging

ZooKeeper uses log4j, following variables can be configured:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  console_threshold     => 'INFO',
  rollingfile_threshold => 'INFO',
  tracefile_threshold   => 'TRACE',
}
```
supported values are: `ALL`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `INFO`, `OFF`, `TRACE` and `WARN`.

## Hiera Support

All parameters could be defined in hiera files, e.g. `common.yaml`, `Debian.yaml` or `zookeeper.yaml`:

```yaml
zookeeper::id: 1
zookeeper::client_port: 2181
zookeeper::datastore: '/var/lib/zookeeper'
zookeeper::datalogstore: '/disk2/zookeeper'
```

## Cloudera package

In Cloudera distribution ZooKeeper package does not provide init scripts (same as in Debian). Package containing init scripts
is called `zookeeper-server` and the service as well. Moreover there's initialization script which should be called after installation.
So, the configuration might look like this:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  packages             => ['zookeeper', 'zookeeper-server'],
  service_name         => 'zookeeper-server',
  initialize_datastore => true
}
```

### Managing repository

For RedHat family currently we support also managing a `cloudera` yum repo versions 4, and 5. It can be enabled with `repo` parameter:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  repo   => 'cloudera',
  cdhver => '5',
}
```

#### Custom RPM repository

Optionally you can specify a custom repository, using a hash configuration.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  cdhver     => '5',
  repo       =>  {
    name  => 'myrepo',
    url   => 'http://cusom.url',
    descr => 'description'
  }
}
```

## Source package

Source packages provide the ability to install arbitrary versions of ZooKeeper on any platform. Note that you'll likely have to use the `manage_service_file` in order to be able to control the ZooKeeper service (because source packages do not install service files).

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  install_method  => 'archive',
  archive_version => '3.4.8',
}
```

## Java installation

Default: `false`

By changing these two parameters you can ensure, that given Java package will be installed before ZooKeeper packages.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  install_java => true,
  java_package => 'openjdk-7-jre-headless'
}
```

## Install

### Librarian (recommended)

For [puppet-librarian](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) just add to `Puppetfile`

from Forge:
```ruby
mod 'deric-zookeeper'
```

latest (development) version from GitHub
```ruby
mod 'deric-zookeeper', git: 'git://github.com/deric/puppet-zookeeper.git'
```

### submodules

If you are versioning your puppet conf with git just add it as submodule, from your repository root:

    git submodule add git://github.com/deric/puppet-zookeeper.git modules/zookeeper

## Dependencies

  * stdlib `> 2.3.3` - function `ensure_resources` is required
  * puppet-archive `> 0.4.4` - provides capabilities to use archives instead of binary packages
